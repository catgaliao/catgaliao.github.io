<p> updates</p>
  <p> spring break is here! the trees are bursting with flowers (and pollen) and pepper is doing amazing. I have spent some time observing her behavior and i just put some toilet paper with my scent on it in her cage. It's non-harmful to hamsters and will help pepper get used to me. Even though getting Pepper wasn't exactly recent; I haven't been interacting much with her. she has been hiding in her nurrow and eating ALL her food! anyways, thanks to the people who are viewing this article, sayonara~ have a good day! </p>
  <p> Old updates (If you haven't cught up)
<p> I am very sad to announce that blossom is dead. she fell down three flights of stairs and the last time I saw her was on november 29th. I'm sorry I haven't been updating the webstite, It makes me melancholy to look at "blossom's playtime corner". I do have a new hamster, Pepper coupon. I will provide photos soon. Have a great day.</p>
