<p> updates</p>
<p> I am very sad to announce that blossom is dead. she fell down three flights of stairs and the last time I saw her was on november 29th. I'm sorry I haven't been updating the webstite, It makes me melancholy to look at "blossom's playtime corner". I do have a new hamster, Pepper coupon. I will provide photos soon. Have a great day.</p>
  <p> R.I.P Blossom. 10/16/24-12/4/24 <p>
