  <h1> how to build websites in html </h1>
  <p> for this website tutorial we are going to use a free website hosting service like Github pages. now this won't be perfect, so you won't be able to have a dataBase If you want users </p>
  <p> you'll need an e-mail to sign up to gtihub. be sure to use strong password characters including lowwercase letters, uppercase letters, and sybols. and DON'T use a word from the dictionary </p>
  <p> Step one: create the body: every website needs the body or barebones script to work. If you have a repository on github pages, youre first step is to create a file called index.html. this file will serve as your homepage. </p>
  <p> to do this in github, go to settings, pages , danger zone, and enable github pages. next, make your repository PUBLIC. your website will be https://replacewithyourusername.github.io </p>
  <p> then make a seperate html file named testing.htm or testing.html. I reccomend w3schoold for learning the coding basics of html.
  this way if you want, try using a hyperlik code on your new website, put some stuff on the extra page -you can keep it or leave it for a test- and see if it works out!</p>
