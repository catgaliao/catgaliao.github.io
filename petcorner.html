  <p> explanation: this is pepper's playtime corner! after the recent death of blossom, I got a new hamster. look at this blog for updates when I feel like it. </p>
  <p> Let's look at some photos! </p>
  <p> Pepper is NOT active at all, hilarious, right? she has only been coming out of the burrow she built underground for food and the occasional pet. I have managed to get a few photos of her, so enjoy these! </p>
  <p> Pepper is still scared of me a little. she's starting to get familiar with my scent though. I feel as though we haven't bonded, even though I have had her as a pet for so long now. </p>
  <p> please report a broken site if the page breaks for some reason. </p>
