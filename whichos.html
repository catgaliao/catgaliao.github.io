  <h1> Operating systems, Which should i get in 2024 </h1>
  <p> In this review, i'll be disscussing the benefits and doubts of these picks for 2024</p>
  <p> Number 1: Windows11. It's No suprise that microsoft's latest (and maybe not so greatest) OS would be popular in 2024. this operating system has new features, new ai capabilities, and a new UI from windows 10. </p>
  <p> although this operating system is everything you could expect for a standar operating system, many pc users who upgrade to windows 11 from windows 10 expirience major lag and compatibility issues. </p>
  <p> Number 2: linux?: although this seems a little fetch today, linux is an amazing deveopment tool, coding language , and is great for hobbyists. linux is open source and free, and their are different "flavors" of linux. such as debian, susu, and on and on.</p>
  <p> although most forms of linux run on command line, operating systems such as linux mint are Graphical User interefaces. Ubuntu is my persanol favorite.
  Windows 10 stll works great and runs on many PC's everywhere. although you may get bad preformance for ARM machines and older computers.</p>
